Day 5 Summary

Web Evolution and Data Representation
Web Versions:
Web 1.0: Static websites with non-interactive content.
Web 2.0: Interactive web with user-generated content.
Web 3.0: Semantic web where all data is interconnected and accessible.
Example:
CHATGPT: An AI model that understands and generates text based on input.
URLs and URIs
URL (Uniform Resource Locator): Identifies a specific resource on the web.
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): A broader category that includes URLs and URNs.
URN (Uniform Resource Name): Identifies resources by name rather than location.
IRI (International Resource Identifier): Extends URIs to support international characters.
Examples:
ISBN/ISSN: Identifiers for books or serials, not web addresses but URNs.
RDF (Resource Description Framework)
Purpose: Describes resources and relationships on the web.
Literals: Basic values or data in RDF, such as strings or numbers.
Formats:
TURTLE üê¢: An RDF serialization format.
JSON-LD, N3: Other RDF serialization formats.
Differences Between WWW and the Internet
WWW (World Wide Web): A collection of web pages.
Internet: The underlying network hosting websites.
Example:
TikTok: Hosted globally but may have regional restrictions, like being disabled in certain countries.
URL Prefixes and Standardization
Prefixes: Standardized namespaces for URLs, important for linking and identifying resources accurately.
Data Interchange Formats
JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, used for data interchange.
XML: eXtensible Markup Language, used for document and data interchange.
Turtle: Terse RDF Triple Language, a serialization format for RDF.
Additional Concepts
Rewrite Engine: Used to rewrite URLs, often specified in .htaccess files.
.htaccess: Configuration file for web server directives.
Mendeley: Reference manager and academic social network.
Key Takeaways
Web Development: Understanding the evolution of the web helps in designing better applications.
Data Representation: Using RDF and understanding different serialization formats is crucial for data interoperability.
URL and URI: Knowing the difference between URLs, URIs, URNs, and IRIs is important for resource identification.
WWW vs. Internet: Distinguishing between these helps in understanding the scope and functionality of web applications.
Tools and Formats: Familiarity with tools like Mendeley and formats like JSON, XML, and Turtle enhances data management and integration skills.
