Day 1 Summary

What is Semantic Web?
Semantic: Describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in a specific language.

Web Semantic: A web capable of describing things in a way that computers can understand. It enriches the web with machine-interpretable metadata, allowing computer programs to derive new information predictably.

Importance of Semantic HTML
Header: Instead of using a div with id=header, use the <header> tag for better performance and clarity.
Sidebar: Use the <aside> tag.
Footer: Use the <footer> tag.
Section: Avoid using div for sections. Using semantic tags improves speed and performance without refreshing the whole page.
Key Concepts
Blockchain: A decentralized form of data management, often associated with Web 3.0.
Authentication: Utilizes end-to-end encryption for secure data access.
Technologies
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for securely sharing data without server availability.
Dynamic Websites: Only load the necessary content instead of refreshing the entire page.
Applications
POS (Point of Sale): Systems installed in places like Decathlon increase speed and efficiency in transactions.
