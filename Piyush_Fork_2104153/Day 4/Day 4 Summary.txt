Day 4 Summary

Relationships in Data and Web
Example: Swiggy
Ordering: One person orders food.
Cooking: Another person cooks the food without knowing the person who ordered.
Delivery: A third person delivers the food without knowing the cook or the customer.
Relationships: All three have interconnected roles but do not directly interact.
RDF (Resource Description Framework)
Purpose: Represents interconnected data on the web using a graph structure (triples).
Triple: Consists of a subject, predicate, and object.
Subject: The resource or concept.
Predicate: A property or attribute of the subject.
Object: The value of the predicate.
Use: Describes and exchanges metadata, integrates data from multiple sources.
Importance: Fast and efficient for data representation and exchange.
Types of Data Representation
Document Relationship
People
Concepts
Data Objects
Metadata Exchange
Purpose: To exchange data with users and the internet.
User Behavior: Different metadata for each page to personalize user experience based on search history.
Semantic Metadata
Describes the meanings of values and names of data components for human and programmatic use.
Homework Topics
Linked Data: Core of the Semantic Web, links datasets understandable to both humans and machines.
FOAF (Friend of a Friend): RDF vocabulary for describing people, activities, and relationships.
Data Formats: JSON and XML
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
Readability: More readable and concise.
Data Types: Supports strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans, and null.
Structure: Compact key/value pairs.
Usage: Common in web APIs and configuration files.
XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
Readability: More verbose due to nested elements.
Data Types: Represented as text, interpreted for types.
Structure: Nested elements.
Usage: Document formats, configuration files, complex data representation.
Practical Tasks
Create a Website:

Use semantic tags like <header>.
Replace <div> with appropriate section tags.
Include syntax of RDF for metadata.
JSON and XML:

Task 1: Create a JSON structure.
Task 2: Create an XML structure.
