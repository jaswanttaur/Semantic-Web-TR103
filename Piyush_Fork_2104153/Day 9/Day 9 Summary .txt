Using JSON or XML in Web Applications
Formats for Data Exchange
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are both formats commonly used for data exchange in web applications.
Incorporating JSON or XML Data
Methods: Use techniques to incorporate JSON or XML data into applications:
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): Enables asynchronous data retrieval without reloading the entire page.
Fetch API: Modern approach to making network requests, particularly useful for fetching JSON data asynchronously.
Postman for API Testing
Postman: Tool used for testing and developing APIs by sending requests and inspecting responses. It helps developers interact with APIs more efficiently.
Fetching and Displaying Data
Fetching Data: Use JavaScript to fetch JSON or XML data from a server or API endpoint.
Displaying Data: Once fetched, display specific information (e.g., names, details) on a webpage dynamically.
Tasks
Task 1: Implement a scenario involving the usage of JSON or XML data in a web application.
Task 2 (JSON): Specifically focus on tasks related to handling JSON data, such as parsing, manipulating, or displaying it dynamically on a webpage.
These tasks will help reinforce your understanding and practical application of JSON and XML in web development.
