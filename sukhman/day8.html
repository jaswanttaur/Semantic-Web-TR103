            QWL: Refers to Web Ontology Language (OWL) used to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things.<br>
            Web Ontology Language: A language used to define and instantiate Web ontologies.<br><br>
            Ontology - relationship between objects: Ontologies describe the relationships and hierarchy between different concepts.<br>
            2 versions OWL 2: There are two main versions of OWL - OWL and OWL 2, with OWL 2 being the latest version.<br><br>
            Relationship concept instances: Instances are specific examples of concepts, which are classes or entities in ontologies.<br>
            Concept represents set of class or entity used to classify other classes or individuals: Concepts are abstract representations that group similar objects or individuals.<br><br>
            Instances refer to things referred to concept, abstract: Instances are specific objects or individuals that fall under a concept.<br><br>
            Relationships - how objects are related to one another: Relationships define how different objects or instances are connected in an ontology.<br><br>
            Used to make rich elements: OWL is used to create detailed and comprehensive data models.<br>
            Complete structure is made: OWL provides a framework for creating a complete and interconnected data structure.<br><br>
            VOWL visual ontology: VOWL (Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies) is a tool for visually representing ontologies.<br>
